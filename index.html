    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>This site will contain my writing and projects relating to my various interests: drawing, animation, physics, 
        math, programming, etc. I hope to write up a post every day. Please mind the formatting, I have yet to decide on 
        a hugo template I want to implement.

    <h3>2/1/2025: Grinding Algorithms and Operating Systems</h3>
    <p>My goal for this February is to read through Skiena's book and CSAPP. I downloaded Knuth's TAOCP,
        and may take a peruse. This week I'll go through a first pass of Skiena.

    <h3>Books I'm reading</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Topology, geometry and gauge fields: Foundations - Naber</li>
        <li>Mathematical gauge theory - Hamilton</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing out Moonray... Dreamworks ray-tracing renderer</h3>
    <p>I've loved the How To Train Your Dragon series, and have marvelled at the stunning way light was incorporated into the movies (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awuqJuO5WOc">Toothless in Cave</a>). I've
    been interested in how animation pipelines work. One of the benefits of Moonray is that it is fast, and can scale across networked hardware for interactive rendering.

    <h2>Book Reviews</h2>
    <h3>Landau: Mechanics</h3>
    <p>I am starting my journey to complete Landau's "theoretical minimum" in the hopes of making sure I have sufficient breadth of knowlege to
        start physics research and start applying to grad schools. I plan to go through this book rather quickly (~2 weeks) as I have a good grasp
        of mechanics, but I wish to be thorough (that is, do every problem in the book).
