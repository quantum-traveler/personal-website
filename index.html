    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>This site will contain my writing and projects relating to my various interests: drawing, animation, physics, 
        math, programming, etc. I hope to write up a post every day. Please mind the formatting, I have yet to decide on 
        a hugo template I want to implement.

    <h3>11/8/24: Learning C++ by making a physics engine</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h3>11/8/25:Easy desktop applications with Wails + Go + Vue</h3>
    <p>Wails is a super easy and well documented way to make desktop GUIs with Go. You can pick several front-end frameworks, but I chose 
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, because that is the JS framework I chose to stick with.

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h3>Acoustic Pressure physics engine</h3>
    <h3>MEEP simulations - evolutionary antenna design</h3>

    <h2>Book Reviews</h2>
    <h3>Landau: Mechanics</h3>
    <p>I am starting my quest to complete Landau's "theoretical minimum" in the hopes of making sure I have sufficient breadth of knowlege to
        start physics research and start applying to grad schools. I plan to go through this book rather quickly (~3 weeks) as I have a good grasp
        of mechanics, but I wish to be thorough (that is, do every problem in the book).
