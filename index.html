    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>This site will contain my writing and projects relating to my various interests: drawing, animation, physics, 
        math, programming, etc. I hope to write up a post every day. Please mind the formatting, I have yet to decide on 
        a hugo template I want to implement.
    </p>

    <h3>11/8/24: Learning C++ by making a physics engine</h2>
    <p>I was inspired to make an acoustic pressure hologram by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCC1C5KIeUA">video by Dan Foisy. Luckily, he 
        had shared a git <a href="https://github.com/danfoisy/vdatp">repo</a> with his project designs, which I looked at to get my own simulation up and running.
        I also wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn the widely used graphics library <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a>.
    </a> </p>

    <h3>11/8/25:Easy desktop applications with Wails + Go + Vue</h3>
    <p><a href="https://wails.io/">Wails</a> is a super easy and well documented way to make desktop GUIs with Go. You can pick several front-end frameworks, but I chose 
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, because that is the JS framework I bothered to learn. I wanted to make a video editing application to auto generate anime music videos (AMVs),
        and decided to use wails to display and organize my clips. Of course, <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>, one of the most widely-used video editing software packages, was
        used to deal with the video editing.

    <h3>Geometric Langlands + Monstrous Moonshine</h3>

    <h3>Testing out Moonray... Dreamworks ray-tracing renderer</h3>
    <p>I've loved the How To Train Your Dragon series, and have marvelled at the stunning way light was incorporated into the movies (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awuqJuO5WOc">Toothless in Cave</a>). I've
    been interested in how animation pipelines work. One of the benefits of Moonray is that it is fast, and can scale across networked hardware for interactive rendering.

    <h3>MEEP simulations - evolutionary antenna design</h3>
    <h3>Automatically generated AMVs</h3>
    <h3>One way sound</h3>
    <p><a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2024/09/one-way-street-for-sound-waves.html">This paper</a> demonstrates how loss-compensated non-reciprocal wave propagation is used to make one-way sound.</p>

    <h2>Book Reviews</h2>
    <h3>Landau: Mechanics</h3>
    <p>I am starting my quest to complete Landau's "theoretical minimum" in the hopes of making sure I have sufficient breadth of knowlege to
        start physics research and start applying to grad schools. I plan to go through this book rather quickly (~2 weeks) as I have a good grasp
        of mechanics, but I wish to be thorough (that is, do every problem in the book).

    <h3>Innovation Culture</h3>
    <p>How companies kill their innovation. Not all companies make money from innovation.</p>
