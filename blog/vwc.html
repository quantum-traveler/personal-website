    The general framework for cloud compute is that People connect to the cloud and run queries in the cloud.
    But with the growing local first software movement, more people are using database sync engines to run
    queries locally. This has large compute savings.

    If queries can be ran locally, and people are given the choice of what queries they can run, you can in effect
    vote with your compute on your local computer.

    For example, you can split up a USD animation and have people who support the project choose to help render it.
